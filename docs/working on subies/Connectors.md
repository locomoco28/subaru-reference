## Sumitomo

Used for most OEM connectors on Subarus.

All connectors seem to be documented to this day on their [website](https://prd.sws.co.jp/components/en/) including 3D `STEP` files and CAD drawings which is cool :)  
I didn't archive any drawings as they had a notice not to distribute copies of the files.
