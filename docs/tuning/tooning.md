# Tooning

I gotta find a better name for this lol

Lemme start off by adding some good resources for tuning

## Resources

Here are various resources to help you on your tuning journey

- [Subaru Discord](https://discord.gg/subaru)
  - because that's where I got most of the help for me :p
  - in the `#tuning` channel you will find a pinned message containing Raven's resources. I don't like using Excel but Raven has made a ton of useful spreadsheets that you may find useful.
- [A Subie Newbie Tuning Guide](https://forums.nasioc.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1626520) by BadNoodle
  - [Archived PDF](ASubieNewbieTuningGuide1_0.pdf)
- [`vimsh/mafscaling`](https://github.com/vimsh/mafscaling) (not just for mafscaling)
  - vimsh's amazing tool containing various tuning tools as well as a nice log viewer

You can also find notes on various tuning parts in the [aftermarket parts page](../parts/aftermarket-parts.md)
