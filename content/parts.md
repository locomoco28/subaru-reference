# 3 port boost solenoid

Pierburg `7.01024.02.0`, ~20 bucks  
Using 2 port Jetronic connector, ~5 bucks

easy to find as it's used on many OEM cars like BMWs and hence easy to source

MAC units are said to have sticking issues but some users on the [Subaru Discord] have mentioned to have had no issues with them
